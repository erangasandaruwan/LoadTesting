In an Agile or fundamental testing environment where testing and development happen concurrently, once any application is nearly complete, there’s really only one way to know whether or not the software can handle the actual demands the end users will soon be making. Load testing is the process of putting simulated demand on system tests and demonstrates it's behavior under various conditions. It is possible to use a load testing tool for this, either a commercial version or else a free version.

> [!NOTE]  
> As the best known and most commonly conducted type of performance testing; load testing involves applying default worl loads to a software application to see if it can perform as intended under normal conditions. It is related to its bigger, more hash counterpart, stress testing, but load testing ensures that a given function, program, or system can simply handle what it’s designed to handle, whereas stress testing is about overloading things until they break, applying unrealistic or unlikely load scenarios. 

Here are some of the well known testing tools presently available in the market.
